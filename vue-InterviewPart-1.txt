1	What is VueJS
JavaScript Framework for building web app.
Vue js is progressive framework. () Vue js 3 is the current version.We make SPA with vue js.

2	What are the major features of VueJS
Virtual DOM: It uses virtual DOM similar to other existing frameworks such as ReactJS etc. 
Virtual DOM is a light-weight in-memory tree representation of the original HTML DOM and updated without affecting the original DOM.
Components: Used to create reusable custom elements in VueJS applications.
Templates: provides HTML based templates that bind the DOM with the Vue instance data
Routing: Navigation between pages is achieved through vue-router
Light weight: VueJS is light weight library compared to other frameworks.


3	What are the lifecycle methods of VueJS
         Create
         Mount
         Update
         Unmount
       

4	What are the conditional directives
v-else, v-else-if and v-show

5	What is the difference between v-show and v-if directives
`v-if` removes elements from the DOM when the condition is false,
 while `v-show` only toggles the visibility using CSS without removing elements from the DOM.

6	What is the purpose of v-for directive?
loop `v-for` directive in Vue.js is used to render a list of items by iterating over an array or an object.

7	What is a vue instance?
A Vue instance is an object created by the Vue function (`new Vue()`) that forms the root of a Vue application. 
It serves as the central hub where data, methods,
and directives are bound and managed for rendering and reacting to user interactions on the webpage.

8	How do you achieve a conditional group of elements?
<template v-if="condition">

9	How do you reuse elements with a key attribute?
In Vue.js, the `key` attribute is used to manage the reusability of elements by giving them a unique identifier. 
This helps Vue distinguish between elements, ensuring that they are reused, updated, or replaced correctly based on their identity,
particularly useful in dynamic elements like lists to maintain internal state or to trigger transitions.

10	Why should you not use if and for directives together on the same element?
not to use v-if on the same element as v-for. Because v-if directive has a higher priority than v-for

11	Why do you need to use a key attribute on for directive?
In order to track each node’s identity, and thus reuse and reorder existing elements,
 you need to provide a unique key attribute for each item with in v-for iteration. 
 An ideal value for key would be the unique id of each item

12	What are the array detection mutation methods?
push()
pop()
shift()
unshift()
splice()
sort()
reverse()

13	What are the array detection non mutation methods?
filter()
concat()
slice()

14	What are the caveats of array changes detection?
Vue cannot detect changes made directly by setting an array index (e.g., `arr[index] = newValue`) or
 modifying the length of the array (e.g., `arr.length = newLength`). To overcome these limitations, use methods like `Vue.set`, 
`vm.$set`, or array mutation methods (e.g., `push`, `pop`, `splice`).

15	What are the caveats of object changes detection?
Vue cannot detect property addition or deletion in objects. If you add a new property after the object has been created, Vue won’t react to those changes. To overcome this,
 use Vue’s `Vue.set` method or replace the object entirely for reactive updates.

16	How do you use for directive with a range?
v-for directive which repeats the element many times.

17	How do you use for directive on template?
Just similar to v-if directive on template, you can also use a <template> tag with v-for directive to render a block of multiple elements

18	How do you use event handlers?
vue similar to plain javascript. The method calls also support the special $event variable.

19	What are the event modifiers provided by vue?
.stop
.prevent
.capture
.self
.once
.passive
<!-- the click event's propagation will be stopped -->
<a v-on:click.stop="methodCall"></a>

20	What are key modifiers?
modifiers on v-on for handling keyboard events
<!-- only call `vm.show()` when the `keyCode` is 13 -->
<input v-on:keyup.13="show">
