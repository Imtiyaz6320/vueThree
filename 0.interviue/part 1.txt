What is VueJS?

Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It's known for its ease of integration into projects, its reactive data binding, and its approachable syntax, making it a popular choice among developers for creating dynamic web applications

What are the major features of VueJS?

1. Reactive Data Binding: Automatically updates your UI whenever your data changes.
2. Components: Reusable custom elements you can use to build your interface.
3. Templates: VueJS provides HTML based templates that bind the DOM with the Vue instance data
4. Virtual DOM: Improves performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulation.
5. Routing: Navigation between pages is achieved through vue-router
6. Composability: Easily integrate or use alongside other libraries or existing projects.
7. Easy to Learn: With a gentle learning curve, developers can quickly start building user interfaces.VueJS is light weight library compared to other frameworks.

What are the lifecycle methods of VueJS?

Vue.js lifecycle methods are hooks that allow you to execute code at specific stages of a component's life, from creation to destruction. The key lifecycle methods include:

1. beforeCreate: Runs before the instance is fully initialized.
2. created: Runs after the instance is created,
3. beforeMount: Runs right before the mounting begins, before the component is rendered.
4. mounted: Runs after the component is mounted to the DOM, where you can access the reactive component and templates are rendered.
5. beforeUpdate: Runs when data changes, before the DOM is patched and re-rendered.
6. updated: Runs after data changes and the DOM is patched.
7. beforeDestroy: Runs right before tearing down a component, where you can perform cleanup actions.
8. destroyed: Runs after a component is destroyed, cleaning up its instance. 

What are the conditional directives?

templates to control their rendering based on certain conditions. The most commonly used conditional directives are v-if, v-else-if, v-else, and v-show. They allow you to conditionally display or hide elements

What is the difference between v-show and v-if directives?

`v-if` removes or adds elements to the DOM based on a condition, while `v-show` just shows or hides the same element using CSS.

What is the purpose of v-for directive?

The `v-for` directive in Vue.js is used for rendering a list of items by iterating over an array or object. It's a powerful tool for dynamically displaying a collection of data in the template.

also used can also use of as the delimiter instead of in, similar to javascript iterators.

What is vue instance?
Every Vue application works by creating a new Vue instance with the Vue function


How do you achieve conditional group of elements?

 by applying v-if directive on <template>

How do you reuse elements with key attribute?
 try to render the same input element in both v-if and v-else blocks then it holds the previous value as below


 Why should not use if and for directives together on the same element?
 v-for directive has higher priority, so Vue will first try to render the list, and then apply the v-if condition to each item
