1.What is Vue.js, and what are its key features?
Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Key features include:

Reactive data binding
Component-based architecture
Vue Router for single-page applications
Vuex for state management
Single File Components (SFCs)
Directives (v-if, v-for, v-bind, etc.)
What are the major features of VueJS?
1. Reactive Data Binding: Automatically updates your UI whenever your data changes.
2. Components: Reusable custom elements you can use to build your interface.
3. Templates: VueJS provides HTML based templates that bind the DOM with the Vue instance data
4. Virtual DOM: Improves performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulation.
5. Routing: Navigation between pages is achieved through vue-router
6. Composability: Easily integrate or use alongside other libraries or existing projects.
7. Easy to Learn: With a gentle learning curve, developers can quickly start building user interfaces.VueJS is light weight library compared to other frameworks.


2.How do you create a new Vue instance?
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    message: 'Hello Vue!'
  }
});

3.Explain the Vue instance lifecycle hooks.
Vue instance lifecycle hooks are specific methods that allow you to perform actions at different stages of a component's lifecycle. 
The main lifecycle hooks are beforeCreate, created, beforeMount, mounted,beforeUpdate, updated, beforeDestroy, and destroyed.
1. beforeCreate: Runs before the instance is fully initialized.
2. created: Runs after the instance is created,
3. beforeMount: Runs right before the mounting begins, before the component is rendered.
4. mounted: Runs after the component is mounted to the DOM, where you can access the reactive component and templates are rendered.
5. beforeUpdate: Runs when data changes, before the DOM is patched and re-rendered.
6. updated: Runs after data changes and the DOM is patched.
7. beforeDestroy: Runs right before tearing down a component, where you can perform cleanup actions.
8. destroyed: Runs after a component is destroyed, cleaning up its instance. 

4.What is data binding in Vue.js?
Data binding in Vue.js connects the data in your application to the DOM. Vue supports
One-way data binding: Using v-bind or : to bind data to an attribute.
Two-way data binding: Using v-model to bind data to form inputs.

5.What is the difference between v-bind and v-model directives?
v-bind: One-way data binding, binds data to HTML attributes.
<img :src="imageUrl">
v-model: Two-way data binding, synchronizes data between the model and the view
<input v-model="message">

6.How do you handle user input and events in Vue.js?
Use the v-on directive (or @) to listen for DOM events and call methods.
<input v-model="message">
<button @click="handleClick">Click me</button>


7.What is the purpose of computed properties in Vue.js?
Computed properties are used for complex calculations or data transformations, and they cache their results for efficiency.

8.How can you conditionally render elements in Vue.js?
the v-if, v-else, and v-else-if directives. These directives allow you to control the rendering of elements based on certain conditions or expressions.

9.How do you loop through an array in Vue.js using v-for?
can use the v-for directive. It allows you to iterate over an array and render elements for each item in the array.


10.What is the significance of the "key" attribute when using v-for?
The "key" attribute in v-for ensures efficient list rendering by uniquely identifying each item, helping Vue track changes and optimize updates.

11.Explain directives in Vue.js.
Directives are special tokens in the markup that tell the library to do something to a DOM element. Examples include v-if, v-for, v-bind, and v-model.

12.How can you share the data between components in Vue.js application?
Data can be shared between components using:

Props (parent to child)
Custom events with emit (child to parent)
Vuex (global state management)
Provide/Inject (ancestor to descendant)


13.How do you handle conditional rendering using the "v-if" and "v-else" directives?
v-if and v-else directives to handle conditional rendering in Vue.js. true,

14.What are the Jest and Mocha in Vue CLI?
Jest and Mocha are testing frameworks supported by Vue CLI. Jest is used for unit testing with a focus on simplicity, while Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework.

15.What is the usage of $parent?
$parent is used to access the parent component instance from a child component.

16.What is a Key?
A key is a unique identifier for elements in a list rendered by v-for. It helps Vue track elements and optimize re-rendering.

17.Explain the significance of the "ref" attribute in Vue.js and when to use it.
The ref attribute provides a way to access DOM elements or component instances directly. It is used when you need to manipulate DOM elements or access 
component methods directly.
<input ref="myInput">
this.$refs.myInput.focus();


18.What is the "v-once" directive, and how does it differ from other directives?
v-once renders the element and component only once and does not update it on data changes, improving performance for static content.
<p v-once>{{ message }}</p>

19.How do you handle two-way data binding in Vue.js using the "v-model" directive?
Use v-model on form elements to create a two-way binding between the input and the component data.
<input v-model="message">

20.Explain the component Prop.
Props are custom attributes you can register on a component to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
props: ['title']
<child-component :title="parentTitle"></child-component>



21.What is the One-Way Data Flow in Vue.js?
In Vue.js, data flows from parent to child components via props, ensuring a predictable data flow and easier debugging.

22.Explain the concept of event modifiers in Vue.js and provide some examples.
Event modifiers are special keywords that allow you to modify event behavior.
@click.stop - Stops event propagation.
@submit.prevent - Prevents default form submission.
@keyup.enter - Triggers event only on "Enter" key press

23.What is the single file component?
A single file component (SFC) in Vue.js encapsulates HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in a single .vue file, promoting modularity and reusability.

24.How can you handle keyboard events in Vue.js applications?
Use v-on directive with key modifiers.
<input @keyup.enter="submitForm">

25.What is the purpose of the "v-html" directive, and what are its potential security risks?
v-html is used to render raw HTML. It can introduce security risks like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) if the content is not sanitized.

26.What is the Vue CLI, and why is it useful for Vue.js development?
Vue CLI is a command-line tool for scaffolding and managing Vue.js projects, providing features like project templates, plugins, and build tools.

27.How do you handle errors and exceptions in Vue.js applications?
Use error handling lifecycle hooks like errorCaptured or global error handlers with Vue.config.errorHandler.

28.Explain the concept of watchers in Vue.js and when to use them
Watchers observe changes to a data property and execute a callback function when the property changes, useful for asynchronous operations or complex 
data watching.
watch: {
  someData(newVal, oldVal) {
    // Perform action on data change
  }
}


29.How can you render raw HTML in Vue.js templates?
Use the v-html directive.
<div v-html="rawHtml"></div>

30.How do you bind CSS styles dynamically in Vue.js using the "v-bind" directive?
Use v-bind with :style or :class.
<div :style="{ color: activeColor, fontSize: fontSize + 'px' }"></div>

31.Explain the use of filters in Vue.js. Are filters recommended in modern Vue.js applications?
Filters are used to format data in templates. They are not recommended in Vue 3, as their functionality can be replaced with methods or computed properties.

32.What is the purpose of the "v-pre" directive in Vue.js templates?
v-pre skips compilation for this element and all its children, useful for displaying raw mustache syntax.
<span v-pre>{{ raw }}</span>

33.How can you handle and manage the local component state in Vue.js?
Local component state is managed using the data option, storing stateful data.
data() {
  return {
    localState: 'some value'
  };
}

34.What is the Vue.js Devtools, and how can it assist in debugging Vue.js applications?
Vue.js Devtools is a browser extension that provides tools for inspecting and debugging Vue.js applications, 
allowing you to examine component hierarchies, state, and events.

35.How can you handle conditional classes in Vue.js using the "v-bind" directive?
Use v-bind:class to apply classes conditionally.
<div :class="{ active: isActive, 'text-danger': hasError }"></div>

36.Explain the use of the "v-once" directive and its implications for rendering.
v-once renders the element and component only once and does not update it on data changes, improving performance for static content
<p v-once>{{ message }}</p>

37.How do you handle form submissions in Vue.js applications?
Use the v-on:submit.prevent directive to handle form submissions.
<form @submit.prevent="handleSubmit">
  <!-- form inputs -->
</form>


38.What are the differences between "v-show" and "v-if" directives in terms of rendering behavior?
v-if: Completely removes or re-renders elements in the DOM based on condition.
v-show: Toggles the visibility of elements using CSS display.

39.How do you create custom events in Vue.js?
Use $emit to create and dispatch custom events from a child component
this.$emit('custom-event', payload);
<child-component @custom-event="handleEvent"></child-component>

40.Explain the concept of template ref and provide a scenario where you would use it.
ref is used to access DOM elements or component instances directly.
<input ref="myInput">
this.$refs.myInput.focus();

41.How do you manage the application state without using Vuex?
Use local component state, props for parent-to-child data flow, custom events with emit for child-to-parent communication,
 and provide/inject for ancestor-to-descendant state sharing
